I'm still considering whether I should rename this to R-Hex.
The reason I haven't yet is because R-Hex was meant to b statically typed

Wordy is pretty operational right now. Here's the features implemented so far:

*Functions - ability to call them, declare them.
*Classes - can declare classes and class instance variables, and functions
  *Can access instance members now
*Loops - Supports while and for loops 
*Conditionals - support if/else blocks, and finally adheres to block scopes
*Scopes! Finally got it adhere to block scopes in general
*Returns, breaks, cotinues are all supported
  *Functions will always return Void (a null valued object), unless otherwise declared in the function body.
*Comments - line and block statements are supported

What I need to do so far:
*More testing for the list above.
*Direct interaction with Java Class - any Java class
  -Notably, direct use of the Java Standard Library
  
*Multi-file support - So far, I've just been interpreting one file. Need support for many files
  - And with this, how to handle naming
  
*Harsher syntax checking - I'm seeing a significant amount of edge cases pass through the parser
*Further document and comment the source files

Import statements should be like this:
"import "/*FILENAME*/" <-- for non Java classes

For importing Java classes, the syntax for it is:
"import java:\*Java class name (full, binary name if needed)*\"
  -Wildcard imports will not be supported

* try/catch syntax:  try{ /*code*/ }catch(Exception1, Exception2 , ... ExceptionN var){}

*Added string concatenation. You can concat strings to strings and numbers.

*TODO: try/catch structure verification
       import statements
       *More testing for the list above.

*Potential class extension syntax:

class Car : Vehicle{}

*I was thinking of using Python's syntax, which would be like:

class Car(Vehicle){}

*Note: this syntax has yet to be implemented


Wordy | Date: 5/4/2018
*Implemented syntax for class extension and imports. 
 -For imports, I'm allowing aliases so two classes that have the same simple name
  can be implemented.
 -Example use:
 	"import hello.world.Class"
 	"import hello.terra.Class"  <---type conflict
 	
 	with aliases:
 	
 	"import hello.world.Class as Point1"
 	"import hello.terra.Class"   <--no type conflict

*Changed imports to only importing java classes.
 - If you want to access a member in another Wordy file, just do:
      "OtherFile.function() or OtherFile.variable" and etc.
*Currently working on finding a way to load all classes from the "java.lang" package
*Created the WordyCompiler class as a front-end for the compilation part of Wordy.
*Added maps for imported classes and Wordy source files in SymbolTable.
 -Most of the import/java-interaction features are first being implemented in the compile-side
  before the runtime-side. It'll make things easier.
*Will be using Google Guava for reflection related classes
